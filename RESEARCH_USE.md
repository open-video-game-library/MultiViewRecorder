abstract = {Video games are utilized in some studies for evaluation experiments and demonstrations. However, because commercial video games cannot be edited, optimizing them for specific experiments is challenging. Thus, researchers may have to develop their own video games individually, which requires effort and impedes the comparison of their study with other similar studies. To overcome these limitations, in this study, we propose a user-friendly "Open Video Game Library" that can be used by researchers for experiments. We conducted a survey of previous studies and designed video games to meet researcher needs. The library features characteristics such as GUI-based parameter editing, play log output, open-source availability, and support for operation on multiple devices, with the aim of becoming the de facto standard for video games used for research purposes.},
